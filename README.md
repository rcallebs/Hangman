### Gameplay
A user attempts to guess a hidden word shown that at the start, only the length of the word is shown, notated by underscores.  
  
The user will click on any letter of the alphabet to make their guess. If that letter is in the hidden word, the blank underscore will have that specific letter appear above. If a letter appears multiple times in a word a player only needs to guess that letter once to have all instances appear on the gameboard.
  

If a letter is guessed that is not in the word, a piece of a stick figure will be added to the gallows. After six incorrect guesses a full stick figure will appear and that player has lost the round.

If the player guesses the hidden word before the stick figure is completed, they will have won that round. ![Winner](https://i.gifer.com/RL4o.gif)
